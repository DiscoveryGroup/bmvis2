This is BMVis², an interactive graph visualization and analysis
program.

BMVis² depends on bmgraph-java, which is available at
https://github.com/DiscoveryGroup/bmgraph-java.

When bmgraph-java is installed into the local artifact repository, one
can build BMVis² simply by running Maven:

    mvn package

or alternatively use some other build system and include the
bmgraph-java sources in the build.  The classes need to be there at
both compile and at run time.  In addition to bmgraph-java, BMVis²
depends on various other libraries, included as JAR-files in the
lib-directory.
