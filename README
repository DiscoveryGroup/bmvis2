This is BMVis², an interactive graph visualization and analysis
program.

An automatically generated build script is available for use with
Apache Ant.  Alternatively, you can build BMVis² within NetBeans by
opening the provided project file.

BMVis² depends on bmgraph-java, which is available at
https://github.com/DiscoveryGroup/bmgraph-java.  The build script
assumes that bmgraph-java source is located in a sibling directory
bmgraph-java.  In other words, if BMVis² sources are at
/parent/dir/bmvis2, bmgraph-java sources are looked in
/parent/dir/bmgraph-java.
